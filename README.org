* CmdTree
CmdTree uses parts of speech tagging, word dependencies, and apropos descriptions to generate a tree
of Unix commands. In the current implementation, there are only 3 layers - the
first layer hosts the actions, then there are the objects of these actions, then
the more specific objects, and then the Unix command which applies the action to
this specific object.

Here is an extract of output, you may find the full output in
simple/simple-3layer-ascii-output.txt

You may also run python ~./graph_simple/graph.py~ to get the tree for your Unix
system - just be sure to install the dependencies that module imports.

Future Plans
1. Prettier visualization with visjs
2. Fix categorization of descriptions which do not have any verbs
3. Use hypernyms from word net to create more layers for the verbs
4. Create a site to display the visualization
